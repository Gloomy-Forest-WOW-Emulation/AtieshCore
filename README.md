## Introduction

AtieshCore is a *MMORPG* Framework based mostly in C++.


It is derived from *TrinityCore* and *MaNGOS*, the *Massive Network Game Object Server*, and is
based on the code of that project with extensive changes over time to optimize,
improve and cleanup the codebase at the same time as improving the in-game
mechanics and functionality.
